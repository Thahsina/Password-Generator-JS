// typesArr is a array of Objects with key:value pairs.  Item is the obj, lower, upper, number, symbol are keys and wheather checked or not checked (true or false) is the value. Object.vlaues(obj) is a method which gives only the values of the obj passed as parameter. And filter() works just like forloop which runs itself until the end of array or obj to find the values which satisfy the filter condition.
    //   filter(item => Object.values(item)[0])  here the filter condition is it to return the elements which are present at the top of typesErr. false keys are like not present. Therefore this function returns only the true values of the item objs of typeArr.

    // typesCount gives us the number how many are selected

generatedPassword.slice(0,length) the password is being sliced here according to the password length. the generated passwword is randomly generated so this might be more than the password length.Each random func of randomfunc generates random vlaues.
